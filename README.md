## Data Structures

### Arrays
A fixed-size collection of elements accessible via indices.

### Queue
A FIFO data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Linked List
A collection of elements where each node points to the next.

## Algorithms

### Merge Sort
A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.


### Quick Sort
A sorting algorithm that partitions elements around a pivot with average O(n log n) time complexity.


## Trees

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
A tree structure where each nodeâ€™s left child is smaller and the right child is larger.

### Red-Black Tree
A balanced binary search tree ensuring logarithmic time operations by maintaining color properties.
